/* Clearfix appends a pseudo-element after the element which will then clear floats.
    If an element's child elements are floated left/right, then the element's height will collapse.
    Always specify the content property; otherwise, the pseudo-element will not appear.
        (Specify the content as empty, so it's not visible.)
    The clear property will clear both right and left floats. */
